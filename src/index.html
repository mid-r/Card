     Happy Birthday Kit!  <br><br>
    You're probably not aware of your impact on people.
    You are a hidden garden at dawn serene and hushed, yet every leaf and bloom hums with a secret joy that makes me breathe easier and feel alive. 
 <br> 

    Thank you for being my safe space, the one I shared my laughters and random thoughts with. Fine, I can tell that I am also lucky and grateful to have met you. May I get to know you more.
    May everything you wish for be handed to you without the need of taking anything from you. 
 <br>

    With gratitude in my heart and joy in my words, I’ll leave this here a little piece of me for you. Thank you for being part of my world. Enjoy your special day and happy birthday once again.
